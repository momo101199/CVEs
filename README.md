# CVEs

CVE-2018-8440 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows, specifically related to the Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) interface[1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8440)[2](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8440). This vulnerability allows a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the way Windows handles ALPC calls[3](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/906424/).

To create a mermaid flowchart illustrating this CVE, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Components**:
   - **User**: The attacker.
   - **ALPC Interface**: The vulnerable component.
   - **System**: The target system where the attacker gains elevated privileges.

2. **Define the Flow**:
   - **Start**: Attacker initiates the exploit.
   - **Exploit ALPC**: Attacker sends a crafted request to the ALPC interface.
   - **Gain Privileges**: The exploit allows the attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges.
   - **End**: Attacker has elevated privileges on the system.

3. **Create the Mermaid Code**:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Attacker] -->|Initiates exploit| B[ALPC Interface]
       B -->|Sends crafted request| C[System]
       C -->|Gains SYSTEM privileges| D[Elevated Privileges]
   ```

You can use this code in a Mermaid-compatible tool to visualize the flow. If you need further assistance or have any specific requirements for the flowchart, feel free to ask!
